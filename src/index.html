  <p id="tribute-info">Before Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan was the oldest person to assume U.S. presidency. He is also the only actor to become president. His remarkable skill as a charming orator earned him the title "The Great Communicator." People credit his policies for contributing to the demise of Soviet communism. His anti-communism sentiment was certainly a factor to the worsening of relations with the Soviet Union during the beginning of his presidency. U.S.-Soviet relations did improve, however, during Reagan's second term in office. In terms of domestic policies, Reagan proposed massive tax cuts (up to 30%) in both individual and corporate income taxes, massive increase in military expenditures, and significant funding cuts in social-welfare programs such as food stamps, low-income housing, education, Medicaid, etc. It's interesting to note that Reagan himself was raised in a poor family.</p>
